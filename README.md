# Overview

Jinx is a rust library intended to supercede the current CMake crate, while
also providing access to CPack and CTest, as well as allowing parsing of the
JSON object models that each tool is currently capable of generating.

The name "jinx" was chosen as it is a synonym of the word "curse". The "C" in
CMake might officially stand for "Cross platform", but in practice everyone
truly knows it stands for cursed.

TODO: Fill this out as needed
